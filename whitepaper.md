CiBL Protocol: Social GambleFi on Solana
​"The Intersection of Instant Messaging and High-Stakes Prediction"
​1. Abstract
​CiBL is a decentralized Social-GambleFi protocol built on the Solana blockchain. It integrates a high-performance crypto wallet with a real-time chat interface, allowing users to engage in 1-Minute Price Duels. By leveraging Solana's low-latency infrastructure, CiBL ensures transparent, fair, and instant settlement of peer-to-peer challenges.
​2. The Core Mechanism: 1-Minute Duels
​Unlike traditional betting platforms, CiBL focuses on micro-interactions.
​Entry: Users initiate a duel with a chosen amount of SOL.
​Prediction: Participants predict the price movement of a specific asset (e.g., SOL/USDC) over the next 60 seconds.
​Oracle: A secure Cloudflare Worker-based Oracle fetches real-time prices from top-tier exchanges.
​Settlement: The Smart Contract (Anchor-based) automatically distributes the pool to the winner.
​3. Tokenomics & Fee Structure
​CiBL implements a sustainable economic model designed to benefit the protocol and its community.
​Platform Fee: A flat 0.6% fee is applied to every duel.
​Fee Distribution:
​0.3% goes to the Protocol Treasury (for development and marketing).
​0.2% is allocated to the Referral Program (Reward for influencers).
​0.1% is burned or used for Buy-backs of the $CIBL token.
​4. Security & Decentralization
​Non-Custodial: CiBL is a wallet-first application. Users always maintain control of their private keys.
​Escrow-Based: Funds for duels are held in a transparent Solana Smart Contract (Escrow) during the 60-second match, preventing rug-pulls.
​Fair Play: Results are verifiable on-chain, ensuring that neither the platform nor the users can manipulate the outcome.
​5. Roadmap
​Phase 1: Beta Launch (Android APK) & Community Building.
​Phase 2: $CIBL Token Generation Event (TGE) and DEX Listing.
​Phase 3: Multi-asset Duels (BTC, ETH, Memecoins).
​Phase 4: Governance (DAO) - Users vote on fee adjustments.
